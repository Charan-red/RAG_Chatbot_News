        "content": "CNN — In the southern Philippine city of Davao, a spirited mayoral election campaign is in full swing, with candidates and their supporters out canvassing for votes. But one of the leading contenders is conspicuously absent from the stump. Instead he’s 7,000 miles away, languishing in the custody of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Netherlands. Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is awaiting trial at The Hague for crimes against humanity, over a brutal war on drug dealers that killed possibly thousands of people, including many innocents and bystanders, with barely any kind of due process. None of this affects the 80-year-old’s eligibility for the role of mayor of Davao – a job he held, on and off, for two decades. Under Philippine election law, only a criminal conviction in a local court can keep a candidate off the ballot. Duterte could well win Monday’s election, thanks to his enduring popularity in the region, where many credit his two-decade iron grip with tightening up law and order, before he took his brutal zero-tolerance policy nationwide as president from 2016 to 2022. “I grew up here all my life and when I was younger it was very dangerous, killings and fighting everywhere,” said Ian Baldoza, 46, a native of Davao who remains a loyal Duterte supporter. “But as I grew older, I started to understand that those who were killed were drug addicts, dealers and troublemakers.” He praised Duterte for improving public safety, building infrastructure and strengthening law enforcement in the city of 1.8 million people, telling CNN: “You never see people spit on the street or leave trash behind, unlike in other cities.” Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has not been on the campaign trail since his arrest by the International Criminal Court on March 11, 2025. Daniel Ceng/Anadolu/Getty Images Many Davao voters feel similarly, said Cleve Arguelles, a political scientist and head of polling firm WR Numero. “His ICC arrest doesn’t really shake their core of who Duterte is but rather, paradoxically, it only reinforces what Duterte stands for,” he said. Baldoza, the Duterte voter, said he witnessed neighbors killed by hitmen under Duterte’s drug war, yet his Facebook profile is full of pro-Duterte posts. “We’re not looking for a saint, we’re looking for a leader with political will, and the Duterte family has that, especially in the patriarch,” he said. While he has not commented publicly on the race, Duterte’s daughter Sara, the Philippine vice president, thanked supporters on her father’s behalf at a rally on Thursday. “President Rodrigo Duterte thanks you all for your love, your continued support, and your prayers that he will one day be brought back to our country,” she told a crowd in the capital Manila, under heavy rain. Thousands of local posts are up for grabs in the midterm elections across the archipelago nation of about 120 million people, ranging from district councilors and mayors all the way up to legislators.

His old age and frail health also raise questions on the succession for the dynasty, which has not been as solid as it once was, said Ramon Beleno, a political analyst and former professor from Ateneo de Davao University, who has observed elections in the Duterte clan’s bailiwick for more than a decade. “The people of Davao have this perspective that a political dynasty is OK if it’s working,” Beleno said. “But it’s only working as long as the patriarch, the person who established the political dynasty, is still strong.” Opposition camps, in the elder Duterte’s absence from the country, are re-emerging across Davao, according to Beleno. Among them are descendants of the late former national House speaker Prospero Nograles, reigniting a decades-old family rivalry that typifies the nation’s clan-tinged politics. Karlo Nograles is running against Rodrigo Duterte for the mayoralty while his sister, Margarita, a lawyer and rising TikTok influencer, is challenging Paolo. Scandal-hit political dynasty And cracks in the Duterte family name are beginning to show. Vice President Sara Duterte is in a long-running feud with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and faces calls for her impeachment for alleged corruption, which she denies. “In the past months my name and my family name has been dragged through the mud,” she said at the recent rally.

The Dutertes are not the problem of the Philippines,” she said, in a vailed dig at the incumbent Marcos administration, the family’s allies turned enemies. Marcos Jr. hails from perhaps the most famous political family in the nation - he is the son of the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos. Paolo Duterte and his bodyguards were recently embroiled in a nightclub brawl, prompting a businessman to file a complaint against him. He said in a video statement that the clip of the melee circulating on social media was “taken a very long time ago.” If Duterte wins the mayoral election, he can still be sworn in by proxy or in absentia – possibly by a Zoom call, if the ICC allows it, according to political scientist and pollster Arguelles. His day-to-day duties would be delegated to the vice mayor. But if Rodrigo Duterte is not allowed to be sworn in virtually, the runner-up – projected to be Karlo Nograles – would ascend to the seat. Duterte ran the Philippines for six turbulent years, during which his brutal crackdown on drugs – which he openly boasted about – killed many young men from impoverished shanty towns, shot by police and rogue gunmen. According to police data, 6,000 people were killed – but rights groups say the death toll could be as high as 30,000. Duterte’s tough approach on drugs prompted strong criticism from opposition lawmakers who launched a probe into the killings. Duterte in turn jailed his fiercest opponent and accused some news media and rights activists as traitors and conspirators. The ICC has set his next hearing for September 23.",

        "content": "CNN — An Iranian official told CNN that recent indirect talks with the United States aimed at addressing Tehran’s nuclear program and lifting sanctions were “not genuine” from the American side and were likely designed from the outset as a “trap to draw the situation toward tension.” According to the official, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity, Iran evaluates the talks’ interruptions and weekly gaps, which were against Tehran’s preference, as a political and media game by the American side and is now preparing for scenarios in which the talks fail. It comes after US special envoy Steve Witkoff warned on Friday that if the next set of talks in Oman on Sunday were not productive, “then they won’t continue and we’ll have to take a different route.” A US official told CNN Saturday that “President (Donald) Trump is completely sincere in his desire to reach a deal with Iran and is completely committed to getting one.” “The United States will ensure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon, but also wishes for lasting peace in the Middle East, a new relationship with Iran, and for the Iranian people to reach their nations full potential,” said the US official. Sunday’s talks are expected to be high-level only, suggesting that the two sides will discuss a broader framework for moving forward. CNN understands that the technical team, which negotiates on more granular aspects of a deal like sanctions relief, is not expected to attend. Earlier Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi – who is expected to meet Witkoff on Sunday – said Tehran had received “contradictory messages” from the US as “different individuals express different views.” The Iranian source said the American side “is basically not ready for meaningful technical and political talks,” adding that the United States gives “short and general answers” to questions, ignores “main proposals,” and “constantly changes its position” throughout the negotiations. Steve Witkoff attends an interview after in a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov, at Diriyah Palace, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on February 18, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein/Pool/Reuters Related article US warns that if Sunday Iran talks aren’t productive, ‘they won’t continue’ According to the source, this situation has led Iran to conclude that the negotiations “likely will not yield the desired outcome in sanctions relief and economic benefit.” As a result, Tehran is “preparing for the next stage, with political, economic, and other sectors having prepared the necessary scenarios over the past month.” The comments come after Witkoff, in an interview with Breitbart posted Friday, described the US’ expectations for the talks in some of the greatest detail to date. “An enrichment program can never exist in the state of Iran ever again. That’s our red line. No enrichment. That means dismantlement, it means no weaponization, and it means that Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan – those are their three enrichment facilities – have to be dismantled,” Witkoff said. Iran has said it is nonnegotiable that it be allowed to enrich uranium. The Iranian source reiterated to CNN on Saturday that uranium enrichment on Iranian soil is Iran’s “definite red line” in the negotiations, a fact he said the United States “is well aware of.” Iran has long insisted it does not want a nuclear weapon and that its program is for energy purposes. In his interview with Breitbart, the special envoy said the talks are focused exclusively on the nuclear issue, a change from the attempts of the first Trump administration to deal widely with Iran’s aggressive actions in the region.

        "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/10/politics/habeas-corpus-explained",
        "date": null,
        "content": "CNN — The future of habeas corpus has been pushed into the spotlight as President Donald Trump has been involved in discussions inside his administration over potentially taking the extreme step of suspending the procedure. What is habeas corpus? Habeas corpus is a legal principle that allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained or imprisoned to petition for their release in court. Immigrants and rights groups have filed habeas petitions in recent months as Trump has tried to speed up deportations as part of his immigration agenda. Still, habeas petitions are notoriously difficult to win in federal court, and it will be a challenge for most immigrants to obtain lawyers. How serious would suspending habeas corpus be? Lee Kovarsky, law professor at the University of Texas and expert on habeas corpus, said it would be a “national historical disaster.” “The executive could just detain you, and there would be no recourse,” he said. “Obviously they would do it to try to detain certain non citizens, but there’s no reason why it’s limited to them.” White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Friday the administration was “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus and it “depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.” But the Constitution allows habeas corpus to be suspended only when “in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” “The Constitution makes clear that suspension of habeas corpus is to be reserved for actual rebellion or invasion posing the most dire threats to public safety. And Congress has never passed a law authorizing deportations without any court involvement, as Miller suggests,” CNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said. Kovarsky said the reason why suspension of habeas corpus is so restricted “is precisely because it’s so severe.” “You have no right, to a court, to say that you’re being unlawfully detained. So in a way, the cash value of your substantive rights is zero if you don’t have a judge to evaluate them,” he said. What has the Supreme Court said about habeas corpus? The Supreme Court issued a murky, unsigned order on April 7 allowing Trump to use the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations for now while at the same time, the court said migrants subject to deportation under the act were entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal through federal habeas corpus petitions, marking a partial win for migrants. Following the Supreme Court’s decision, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a series of habeas lawsuits seeking to protect identified clients as well as “similarly situated” Venezuelans who could potentially be targeted under the Alien Enemies Act. The Supreme Court also issued a rare overnight order on April 19th where a majority of justices blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of immigrants in Texas. When has habeas corpus come up in other cases? Habeas corpus has been used in US courts including over issues with detaining alleged enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in recent years. The Supreme Court initially ruled in 2008 that detainees at the Guantanamo prison have the right to habeas corpus. In one case, a federal judge ruled in 2021 that the detention of one detainee being held at the US military prison in Guantanamo Bay was unlawful. The judge granted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to Asadullah Haroon Gul, who was accused of being a member of an extremist group. Gul, whom the US went on to repatriate to Afghanistan, became the first detainee at the Guantanamo Bay prison to win a habeas petition in 10 years. Another high-profile case related to habeas corpus involves Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian activist and legal permanent resident who was detained by immigration officers in March. Khali filed a habeas corpus petition to challenge the legality of his detention, and his case still faces legal challenges as he faces deportation. Has habeas corpus been suspended before? Habeas corpus has been suspended only four times in the history of the US, including by former President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. The other three times include “in eleven South Carolina counties overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction; in two provinces of the Philippines during a 1905 insurrection; and in Hawaii after the bombing of Pearl Harbor,” according to the National Constitution Center.",

        "content": "CNN — The battle over immigration came to a dramatic head Friday afternoon when Democratic lawmakers faced off with Homeland Security Department officers as they tried to visit a Newark, New Jersey, Immigration Customs and Enforcement facility, despite Congress’ oversight authority of federal facilities. Three members of Congress from New Jersey, along with protesters, faced off with Department of Homeland Security officers on Friday after visiting a local ICE detention facility. The incident started as officers attempted to arrest the mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, after he tried to join the lawmakers inside the facility. As tensions grew, so did the physicality of the situation, with officers and lawmakers pushing and shouting at one another before Baraka, a Democrat, was ultimately detained for several hours. He was released Friday evening. Under the annual appropriations act, which allocates funds for federal agencies, lawmakers are permitted to enter “any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens.” The law is also clear that members of Congress are not required “to provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility” in their oversight capacity. A spokesperson for Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, one of the lawmakers who was at the facility Friday, said the group had been allowed to enter and inspect the center sometime between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. After the incident, a DHS official suggested charges could be brought against the members of Congress and accused them of breaking into the facility, despite their legal authority to conduct oversight of the department. DHS in a statement accused the lawmakers of being “holed up in a guard shack” after having “stormed the gate” to break “into the detention facility.” “Members of Congress storming into a detention facility goes beyond a bizarre political stunt and puts the safety of our law enforcement agents and detainees at risk,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement. “Members of Congress are not above the law and cannot illegally break into detention facilities.” Watson Coleman, who was at the facility Friday, forcefully pushed back on the allegation that the members had broken into the facility, saying in a statement that afternoon “we did not ‘storm’ the detention center.” “The author of that press release was so unfamiliar with the facts on the ground that they didn’t even correctly count the number of Representatives present,” the congresswoman said. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is led away in handcuffs after he took part in a protest outside an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, on Friday. News 12 New Jersey During an appearance on CNN’s “First of All” Saturday morning, McLaughlin said ICE has footage that could lead to arrests of lawmakers. “There will likely be more arrests coming. We actually have body camera footage of some of these members of Congress assaulting our ICE enforcement officers, including body slamming a female ICE officer. So we will be showing that to viewers very shortly,” she said. When pressed by CNN’s Victor Blackwell on whether she was suggesting the members of Congress would be arrested, McLaughlin said, “this is an ongoing investigation and that is definitely on the table.” The videos were later released by the department and show the arrest of Baraka, along with more angles of the physical altercations between federal agents, protesters and members of Congress. One video appears to show Rep. LaMonica McIver using her body to push past federal agents to follow Baraka after he was placed in handcuffs and moved behind the chain-linked fence. Baraka, to whom the appropriations law doesn’t apply, was held for a few hours before being released. It remains unclear why he was detained outside of the fenced-in area around the facility after he had already left the detention center. “I didn’t go there to break any laws. I didn’t break any laws,” Baraka told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Friday shortly after being released. “I was there as the mayor of the city, exercising my right and duty as an elected official, you know, supporting our congresspeople preparing for a press conference that was supposed to happen there.” DHS has doubled down on its response to the incident, writing in one social media post: “Just because the border is secure doesn’t mean you can find new walls to climb over guys.” CNN’s Shania Shelton contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. CNN — A Soviet-era spacecraft that was designed to make a soft landing on Venus — but instead remained trapped in Earth orbit for decades — likely fell from the sky early Saturday morning, according to the European Space Agency. The object, referred to as Cosmos 482 or Kosmos 482, is believed to be a capsule launched by the Soviet Union in March 1972 that failed en route to a transfer orbit that would have taken it to Venus to study its environment. The probe entered the dense layers of the atmosphere around 9:24 a.m. Moscow time (2:24 a.m. ET) Saturday, splashing down in the Indian Ocean west of Jakarta, Indonesia, according to the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. The ESA, which was one of several organizations using ground sensors to keep tabs on the falling space junk, also said on its website that the vehicle was not spotted by radars in Germany around 7:32 UT (3:32 a.m. ET), indicating, “it is most likely that the reentry has already occurred.” In the decades since it was launched, Cosmos 482 circled Earth aimlessly as it was slowly dragged back toward home. Astronomers and space traffic experts have had their eyes on the object for years now as its orbital path slowly reached lower and lower altitudes, a result of the subtle atmospheric drag that exists even hundreds of miles away from Earth. The cylinder-shaped craft is about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter. This depicts the satellite-filled sky that is now a reality and getting more crowded every week! This adds together exposures taken over just 30 minutes on an early June night when, from my latitude of 51° N satellites even in low Earth orbit are lit all night by sunlight. Many of the parallel streaks heading generally horizontal west to east (right to left) may be from groups of SpaceX Starlinks. Others traveling vertically north-south are more likely from Earth observation satellites. There is at least one natural streak in the image — a meteor at centre, caught by chance on one frame. It appears as a colored and tapered streak. Other uniform undashed streaks may be from high-altitude satellites moving much more slowly. By comparison, most satellites appear as dashed lines because the image is a blend of many 2-second-long exposures with a gap of one second between exposures when the camera shutter was closed. So the motion of the satellites and image stacking turns them into dashes. The longer the dashes, the faster the satellite is traveling, with the fastest satellites being the lowest. This is looking due south and all the trails disappear low in the south above the trees, as that's where the Earth's shadow is, even on this June night. So the satellites aren't lit when they are in that small part of the sky. They emerge from the shadow heading north and disappear into the shadow heading south. The shadow creates the obvious boundary of where satellite trails are visible. At other times of the year low-orbit satellites are visible only after sunset or before sunrise, especially from lower latitudes. But not near summer solstice, and from higher latitudes. The field of view is about 100° by 75°.

Because the spacecraft no longer had the ability to maneuver, it was destined to undergo what space traffic experts refer to as an uncontrolled reentry — plunging back to Earth in a manner that can be extremely difficult to accurately forecast. The sheer complexity of spaceflight and unpredictable factors, such as space weather, complicate efforts to pinpoint exactly when or where an object will fall out of orbit. This particular piece of space junk did not pose a substantial risk to people on the ground, experts told CNN. But it garnered international attention because of Cosmos 482’s unique history. “This object was designed to survive reentering Venus, so there’s fair odds that it’ll survive coming back (to Earth) in one piece,” said Marlon Sorge, a space debris expert with The Aerospace Corporation, on Monday. “That actually makes the risk less … because it would stay intact.” Surviving reentry Often, when spaceborne garbage hurtles back toward Earth, objects such as defunct rocket parts are torn apart by the jarring physics as they can slam into Earth’s thick inner atmosphere while still traveling at more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,000 kilometers per hour). Each of the pieces from the rocket part can then pose a threat to the area where it lands. But Cosmos 482 was well suited to make the trip home in one piece. The spacecraft had a substantial heat shield that protected the vehicle from the intense temperatures and pressures that can build up during reentry. And because Cosmos 482 was designed to reach the surface of Venus — where the atmosphere is 90 times denser than Earth’s — the probe likely remained intact. The Soviet Venera program The Soviet Union’s Space Research Institute, or IKI, ran a groundbreaking Venus exploration program amid the 20th century space race. Venera, as the program was called, sent a series of probes toward Venus in the 1970s and ’80s, with several spacecraft surviving the trip and beaming data back to Earth before ceasing operations. Nauka docks to the Zvezda service module iss065e212164 (July 29, 2021) --- Russia's \"Nauka\" Multipurpose Laboratory Module is pictured shortly after docking to the Zvezda service module's Earth-facing port on the International Space Station with the Brazilian coast 263 miles below.

NASA Related article ‘Possibility of a catastrophic failure’: Inside the space station leak problem that has NASA worried Of the two Venera vehicles that were launched in 1972 , however, only one made it to Venus. The other, a spacecraft sometimes cataloged as V-71 No. 671, did not. And that’s why researchers believed that Cosmos 482 was the failed Venera vehicle. (Beginning in the 1960s, Soviet vehicles left in Earth orbit were each given the Cosmos name and a numerical designation for tracking purposes, according to NASA.) What to do if you spot debris While a landing on dry ground was unlikely, it wasn’t impossible. The Cosmos 482 object’s trajectory showed it could have landed within a broad swath of land that includes “the whole of Africa, South America, Australia, the USA, parts of Canada, parts of Europe, and parts of Asia,” said Marco Langbroek, a lecturer and space traffic expert at Delft Technical University in the Netherlands, via email. Sorge emphasized that if Cosmos 482 had landed on dry ground, onlookers would have been advised to keep their distance. The aged spacecraft could leak dangerous fuels or pose other risks to people and property. “Contact the authorities,” Sorge urged. “Please don’t mess with it.” Legally speaking, the object also belongs to Russia. According to rules mapped out in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty — which remains the primary document underpinning international law on the matter — the nation that launched an object to space retains ownership and responsibility for it even if it crashes back to Earth decades after launch. The big picture Though defunct objects in space routinely fall out of orbit, most pieces of debris disintegrate entirely during the reentry process. But the world is in the midst of a new space race, with commercial companies such as SpaceX launching hundreds of new satellites to orbit each year. That burst in activity has raised alarms across the space traffic community, as experts are seeking to ensure that objects don’t collide in space or pose a risk to humans if they make an uncontrolled descent back home.

        "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. CNN — Researchers have found pages of a rare medieval manuscript masquerading as a cover and stitched into the binding of another book, according to experts at the Cambridge University Library in England. The fragment contains stories about Merlin and King Arthur. The two pages are from a 13th century copy of the “Suite Vulgate du Merlin.” The manuscript, handwritten by a medieval scribe in Old French, served as the sequel to the legend of King Arthur. There are just over three dozen surviving copies of the sequel today. Part of a series known as the Lancelot-Grail cycle, the Arthurian romance was popular among aristocrats and royalty, said Dr. Irène Fabry-Tehranchi, French specialist in collections and academic liaison at Cambridge University Library. The stories were either read aloud or performed by trouvères, or poets, who traveled from court to court, she said. Rather than risk damaging the brittle pages by removing the stitches and unfolding them, a team of researchers were able to conduct imaging and computed tomography, or CT, scans to create a 3D model of the papers and virtually unfurl them to read the story. Multiple analyses enabled Cambridge researchers to virtually unfold the manuscript. Cambridge University Library Fabry-Tehranchi, one of the first to recognize the rarity of the manuscript, said finding it “is very much a once in a lifetime experience.” The scans revealed book-binding techniques from the distant past and hidden details of the repurposed manuscript that could shed light on its origins. “It’s not just about the text itself, but also about the material artefact,” Fabry-Tehranchi said in a statement. “The way it was reused tells us about archival practices in 16th-century England. It’s a piece of history in its own right.” Hiding in plain sight Former Cambridge archivist Sian Collins first spotted the manuscript fragment in 2019 while recataloging estate records from Huntingfield Manor, owned by the Vanneck family of Heveningham, in Suffolk, England. Serving as the cover for an archival property record, the pages previously had been recorded as a 14th century story of Sir Gawain. But Collins, now the head of special collections and archives at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, noticed that the text was written in Old French, the language used by aristocracy and England’s royal court after the Norman Conquest in 1066. She also saw names like Gawain and Excalibur within the text. Collins and the other researchers were able to decipher text describing the fight and ultimate victory of Gawain, his brothers and his father King Loth versus the Saxon Kings Dodalis, Moydas, Oriancés, and Brandalus. The other page shared a scene from King Arthur’s court in which Merlin appears disguised as a dashing harpist, according to a translation provided by the researchers: The pages were folded, torn and stitched together to create a cover for 16th century property records. Cambridge University Library “While they were rejoicing in the feast, and Kay the seneschal (steward) brought the first dish to King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, there arrived the most handsome man ever seen in Christian lands. He was wearing a silk tunic girded by a silk harness woven with gold and precious stones which glittered with such brightness that it illuminated the whole room.” Both scenes are part of the “Suite Vulgate du Merlin” that was originally written in 1230, about 30 years after “Merlin,” which tells the origin stories of Merlin and King Arthur and ends with Arthur’s coronation. “(The sequel) tells us about the early reign of Arthur: he faces a rebellion of British barons who question his legitimacy and has to fight external invaders, the Saxons,” Fabry-Tehranchi said in an email. “All along, Arthur is supported by Merlin who advises him strategically and helps him on the battlefield. Sometimes Merlin changes shape to impress and entertain his interlocutors.” Blue and red flourishes on some of the letters enabled researchers to date the manuscript to the late 13th to early 14th century. Błażej Mikuła/Amélie Deblauwe/Cambridge University Library Tracing the book’s journey The pages had been torn, folded and sewn, making it impossible to decipher the text or determine when it was written. A team of Cambridge experts came together to conduct a detailed set of analyses. After analyzing the pages, the researchers believe the manuscript, bearing telltale decorative initials in red and blue, was written between 1275 and 1315 in northern France, then later imported to England. TINTAGEL, UNITED KINGDOM - APRIL 28: The new 'Gallos' sculpture that has been erected at Tintagel Castle is seen in Tintagel on April 28, 2016 in Cornwall, England. The English Heritage managed site and the nearby town have long been associated with the legend of King Arthur and continue to attract large visitor numbers. However, efforts by English Heritage to update the visitor experience with the Gallos sculpture, along with a rock carving of Merlin's face, which English Heritage say are inspired by the legend of King Arthur and Tintagel Castles royal past, have met with criticism from some Cornish nationalists and historians.

Experts say it offers clues about the truth behind the myth They think it was a short version of the “Suite Vulgate du Merlin.” Because each copy was individually written by hand by medieval scribes, a process that could take months, there are distinguishing typos, such as “Dorilas” instead of “Dodalis” for one of the Saxon kings’ names. “Each medieval copy of a text is unique: it presents lots of variations because the written language was much more fluid and less codified than nowadays,” Fabry-Tehranchi said. “Grammatical and spelling rules were established much later.” Some of the text, written in Old French, was faded or worn over time, likely by a leather strap. Błażej Mikuła/Amélie Deblauwe/Cambridge University Library But it was common to discard and repurpose old medieval manuscripts by the end of the 16th century as printing became popular and the true value of the pages became their sturdy parchment that could be used for covers, Fabry-Tehranchi said. “It had probably become harder to decipher and understand Old French, and more up to date English versions of the Arthurian romances, such as (Sir Thomas) Malory’s ‘Morte D’Arthur’ were now available for readers in England,” Fabry-Tehranchi said. The updated Arthurian texts were edited to be more modern and easier to read, said Dr. Laura Campbell, associate professor in the School of Modern Languages and Cultures at Durham University in Durham, England, and president of the British branch of The International Arthurian Society. Campbell was not involved in the project, but has previously worked on the discovery of another manuscript known as the Bristol Merlin. In a scene from the Bayeux Tapestry, Harold Godwinson (the future King Harold II) confers with King Edward the Confessor (c.1003 - 1066) before sailing from Bosham, 1064.

The team carried out CT scanning with an X-ray scanner to virtually peer through the parchment layers and create a 3D model of the manuscript fragment, revealing how the pages had been stitched together to form a cover. The CT scans showed there was likely once a leather band around the book to hold it all in place, which rubbed off some of the text. Twisted straps of parchment, called tackets, along with thread reinforced the binding. Scans across different wavelengths of light enabled the researchers to see hidden details and annotations. Błażej Mikuła/Amélie Deblauwe/Cambridge University Library “A series of specialised photographic equipment such as a probe lens as well as simple accessories such as mirrors were used to photograph otherwise inaccessible parts of the manuscript,” said Amélie Deblauwe, a photographer at Cambridge University Library’s Cultural Heritage Imaging Laboratory. The research team digitally assembled hundreds of images to create a virtual copy of the pages. “The creation of these digital outputs including the virtual unfolding, traditional photography, and (multispectral imaging) all contribute to the preservation of the manuscript in its reused form, while revealing as much of the original contents as possible,” Deblauwe said. The researchers believe the methodology they developed for this project can be applied to other fragile manuscripts, especially those repurposed for other uses over time, to provide a nondestructive type of analysis. The team plans to share the methodology in an upcoming research paper.",

CNN — Things are heating up hundreds of miles off the coast of Oregon, where a large undersea volcano is showing signs of impending eruption, scientists say. The volcano, known as Axial Seamount, is located nearly 1 mile (1.4 kilometers) underwater on a geological hot spot, where searing gushes of molten rock rise from Earth’s mantle and into the crust. Hotspot volcanoes are common on the seafloor. But Axial Seamount also happens to be located on the Juan de Fuca Ridge — an area where two massive tectonic plates (the Pacific and the Juan de Fuca plates) are constantly spreading apart, causing a steady buildup of pressure beneath the planet’s surface. The frequency of earthquakes has recently picked up dramatically as the volcano inflates with increasingly more magma, signaling an eruption could be near, according to researchers at the National Science Foundation’s Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array, a facility operated by the University of Washington that monitors the activity of Axial Seamount. CN7CJ3 Uturuncu volcano in Bolivia in South America Michael Sayles/Alamy Stock Photo Related article Scientists explore the anatomy of a ‘zombie volcano’ that’s showing signs of activity “At the moment, there are a couple hundred earthquakes a day, but that’s still a lot less than we saw before the previous eruption,” said William Wilcock, a marine geophysicist and professor at the University of Washington School of Oceanography who studies the volcano. “I would say it was going to erupt sometime later (this year) or early 2026, but it could be tomorrow, because it’s completely unpredictable,” he said. What happens during an eruption? During the volcano’s last eruption in April 2015, the team observed about 10,000 small-scale earthquakes in a 24-hour period, and the same can be expected for the next one, Wilcock said. Magma — molten rock beneath Earth’s surface — oozed out of Axial Seamount for a month and trailed about 25 miles (40 kilometers) across the seafloor, he added. The magma chamber at the heart of the volcano has also collapsed several times in the past, creating a large crater called a caldera. There, sea life thrives off the mineral-rich gases that exit through hydrothermal vents, which are like underwater hot springs. Streams of hot fluid containing billions of microbes and clumps of waste billow up from cracks in the caldera’s surface, creating white plumes called “snowblowers.” During previous eruptions, the small plants and animals living on the hydrothermal vents were scorched by lava flows, but just three months later, their ecosystem was back and flourishing again, said Debbie Kelley, director of the Regional Cabled Array. “I think it’s one of the biggest discoveries we’ve made,” said Kelley, a professor of marine geology and geophysics at the University of Washington, in a statement. “Life thrives in these inhospitable environments, and volcanoes are probably one of the major sources of life in our oceans.” White clouds of microbial waste billow from the seafloor. UW/NSF-OOI/CSSF-ROPOS While neighboring marine life such as fish, whales and octopuses may feel the heat and rumble of seismic shifting, they are unlikely to be harmed. And people on land probably won’t notice the eruption at all, Kelley told CNN. “It’s not a very explosive event. You won’t see the ash clouds above water, anything like that,” she said. “It’s like if you put a mile of seawater on top of Kilauea … you may see some fountaining, but that’s it.” In fact, most of the planet’s volcanic activity takes place within underwater spreading centers such as the Juan de Fuca Ridge, which experiences multiple, small volcanic eruptions each day, Kelley said. “The magma’s pretty close to the surface. It’s about a mile beneath the surface, which is very shallow compared with a lot of land volcanoes, where it may be 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) deep,” Kelley said, adding that the viscosity, or thickness, of the magma can affect how much pressure builds up in the magma chamber. Like a thick tomato sauce cooking on the stove, air bubbles within high-viscosity magma rupture more dramatically than Axial Seamount’s thinner, runnier magma.

Ed Ruttledge/U.S. Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory Related article Why Mount Rainier is the US volcano that troubles scientists most How to watch Luckily, the relative mildness of Axial Seamount makes it perfect for close human observation. The next time the volcano erupts, the observatory even plans to publicly livestream the event, which has never been done before, Kelley said. Observing an undersea volcanic eruption is no easy task. Scientists only directly witnessed one in action for the first time on April 29. In the Pacific Ocean, about 1,300 miles (2,092 kilometers) west of Costa Rica, researchers partnering with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, or WHOI, were on a routine submersible dive to collect data on the East Pacific Rise when they noticed the once-vibrant Tica vents were no longer teeming with sea life. Instead, the team found a charred “tubeworm barbeque,” as WHOI Emeritus Research Scholar Dan Fornari put it. Flashes of orange lava leaked through the seafloor before hardening in the freezing water, indicating an eruption was taking place. “It’s quite a significant development,” Fornari said. “It’s a very understudied environment, because it’s hard to reach and because we have to use clever technology to understand it. … At the heart of it, we are watching (the) ways in which this planet gets built, gets constructed by volcanism on the seafloor.” Tubeworms grow on the unique rock formations of the Axial Seamount. UW/NSF-OOI As above, so below Unexpectedly, close observation of Axial Seamount has revealed the timing of its eruption isn’t just about what’s bubbling beneath the surface — it also has to do with what’s above. All three of the most recent eruptions — in 1998, 2011 and 2015 — have occurred between January and April, the time of year when Earth is moving away from the sun. “I don’t think we fully understand why that is, but it may be related to the (gravitational) forces from the moon influencing the volcano,” Wilcock said.

John Fhær Engedal Nissen/The National Museum of Denmark Related article Archaeologists discover true identity of Costa Rica shipwrecks long thought to be pirate ships The moon orbits Earth each month, and its gravitational pull moves ocean tides up and down, causing pressure variations on the seafloor. As the volcano’s magma chamber reaches critical mass, these pressure changes put more stress on the caldera, the crater of the volcano created by previous eruptions. The pressure of high tide also causes more frequent earthquakes, slowly stressing the chamber to its breaking point, Kelley said.",
