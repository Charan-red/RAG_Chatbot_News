He might win\nDATE: None\n\nCNN \u2014 In the southern Philippine city of Davao, a spirited mayoral election campaign is in full swing, with candidates and their supporters out canvassing for votes. But one of the leading contenders is conspicuously absent from the stump. Instead he\u2019s 7,000 miles away, languishing in the custody of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Netherlands. Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is awaiting trial at The Hague for crimes against humanity, over a brutal war on drug dealers that killed possibly thousands of people, including many innocents and bystanders, with barely any kind of due process. None of this affects the 80-year-old\u2019s eligibility for the role of mayor of Davao \u2013 a job he held, on and off, for two decades. Under Philippine election law, only a criminal conviction in a local court can keep a candidate off the ballot. Duterte could well win Monday\u2019s election, thanks to his enduring popularity in the region, where many credit his two-decade iron grip with tightening up law and order, before he took his brutal zero-tolerance policy nationwide as president from 2016 to 2022. \u201cI grew up here all my life and when I was younger it was very dangerous, killings and fighting everywhere,\u201d said Ian Baldoza, 46, a native of Davao who remains a loyal Duterte supporter. \u201cBut as I grew older, I started to understand that those who were killed were drug addicts, dealers and troublemakers.\u201d He praised Duterte for improving public safety, building infrastructure and strengthening law enforcement in the city of 1.8 million people, telling CNN: \u201cYou never see people spit on the street or leave trash behind, unlike in other cities.\u201d Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has not been on the campaign trail since his arrest by the International Criminal Court on March 11, 2025. Daniel Ceng/Anadolu/Getty Images Many Davao voters feel similarly, said Cleve Arguelles, a political scientist and head of polling firm WR Numero. \u201cHis ICC arrest doesn\u2019t really shake their core of who Duterte is but rather, paradoxically, it only reinforces what Duterte stands for,\u201d he said. Baldoza, the Duterte voter, said he witnessed neighbors killed by hitmen under Duterte\u2019s drug war, yet his Facebook profile is full of pro-Duterte posts. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for a saint, we\u2019re looking for a leader with political will, and the Duterte family has that, especially in the patriarch,\u201d he said. While he has not commented publicly on the race, Duterte\u2019s daughter Sara, the Philippine vice president, thanked supporters on her father\u2019s behalf at a rally on Thursday. \u201cPresident Rodrigo Duterte thanks you all for your love, your continued support, and your prayers that he will one day be brought back to our country,\u201d she told a crowd in the capital Manila, under heavy rain. Thousands of local posts are up for grabs in the midterm elections across the archipelago nation of about 120 million people, ranging from district councilors and mayors all the way up to legislators.

Among them are descendants of the late former national House speaker Prospero Nograles, reigniting a decades-old family rivalry that typifies the nation\u2019s clan-tinged politics. Karlo Nograles is running against Rodrigo Duterte for the mayoralty while his sister, Margarita, a lawyer and rising TikTok influencer, is challenging Paolo. Scandal-hit political dynasty And cracks in the Duterte family name are beginning to show. Vice President Sara Duterte is in a long-running feud with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and faces calls for her impeachment for alleged corruption, which she denies. \u201cIn the past months my name and my family name has been dragged through the mud,\u201d she said at the recent rally. A Catholic nun walks past portraits of victims of former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs displayed during a mass for victims at a church in Manila on March 11, 2025. Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte was arrested that day by police acting on an International Criminal Court warrant tied to his deadly war on drugs. Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty Images Related article For the families still grieving Duterte\u2019s brutal drug war, the ICC might be their only hope \u201cI have repeatedly said this before, and I will say it again now \u2013 I am not the problem of this country. The Dutertes are not the problem of the Philippines,\u201d she said, in a vailed dig at the incumbent Marcos administration, the family\u2019s allies turned enemies. Marcos Jr. hails from perhaps the most famous political family in the nation - he is the son of the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos. Paolo Duterte and his bodyguards were recently embroiled in a nightclub brawl, prompting a businessman to file a complaint against him. He said in a video statement that the clip of the melee circulating on social media was \u201ctaken a very long time ago.\u201d If Duterte wins the mayoral election, he can still be sworn in by proxy or in absentia \u2013 possibly by a Zoom call, if the ICC allows it, according to political scientist and pollster Arguelles. His day-to-day duties would be delegated to the vice mayor. But if Rodrigo Duterte is not allowed to be sworn in virtually, the runner-up \u2013 projected to be Karlo Nograles \u2013 would ascend to the seat. Duterte ran the Philippines for six turbulent years, during which his brutal crackdown on drugs \u2013 which he openly boasted about \u2013 killed many young men from impoverished shanty towns, shot by police and rogue gunmen. According to police data, 6,000 people were killed \u2013 but rights groups say the death toll could be as high as 30,000. Duterte\u2019s tough approach on drugs prompted strong criticism from opposition lawmakers who launched a probe into the killings.

What is habeas corpus? Habeas corpus is a legal principle that allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained or imprisoned to petition for their release in court. Immigrants and rights groups have filed habeas petitions in recent months as Trump has tried to speed up deportations as part of his immigration agenda. Still, habeas petitions are notoriously difficult to win in federal court, and it will be a challenge for most immigrants to obtain lawyers. How serious would suspending habeas corpus be? Lee Kovarsky, law professor at the University of Texas and expert on habeas corpus, said it would be a \u201cnational historical disaster.\u201d \u201cThe executive could just detain you, and there would be no recourse,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously they would do it to try to detain certain non citizens, but there\u2019s no reason why it\u2019s limited to them.\u201d White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Friday the administration was \u201cactively looking at\u201d suspending habeas corpus and it \u201cdepends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.\u201d But the Constitution allows habeas corpus to be suspended only when \u201cin Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\u201d \u201cThe Constitution makes clear that suspension of habeas corpus is to be reserved for actual rebellion or invasion posing the most dire threats to public safety. And Congress has never passed a law authorizing deportations without any court involvement, as Miller suggests,\u201d CNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said. Kovarsky said the reason why suspension of habeas corpus is so restricted \u201cis precisely because it\u2019s so severe.\u201d \u201cYou have no right, to a court, to say that you\u2019re being unlawfully detained. So in a way, the cash value of your substantive rights is zero if you don\u2019t have a judge to evaluate them,\u201d he said. What has the Supreme Court said about habeas corpus? The Supreme Court issued a murky, unsigned order on April 7 allowing Trump to use the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations for now while at the same time, the court said migrants subject to deportation under the act were entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal through federal habeas corpus petitions, marking a partial win for migrants. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a series of habeas lawsuits seeking to protect identified clients as well as \u201csimilarly situated\u201d Venezuelans who could potentially be targeted under the Alien Enemies Act. The Supreme Court also issued a rare overnight order on April 19th where a majority of justices blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of immigrants in Texas. When has habeas corpus come up in other cases? Habeas corpus has been used in US courts including over issues with detaining alleged enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in recent years. The Supreme Court initially ruled in 2008 that detainees at the Guantanamo prison have the right to habeas corpus. In one case, a federal judge ruled in 2021 that the detention of one detainee being held at the US military prison in Guantanamo Bay was unlawful. The judge granted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to Asadullah Haroon Gul, who was accused of being a member of an extremist group. Gul, whom the US went on to repatriate to Afghanistan, became the first detainee at the Guantanamo Bay prison to win a habeas petition in 10 years. Another high-profile case related to habeas corpus involves Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian activist and legal permanent resident who was detained by immigration officers in March. Khali filed a habeas corpus petition to challenge the legality of his detention, and his case still faces legal challenges as he faces deportation. Has habeas corpus been suspended before? Habeas corpus has been suspended only four times in the history of the US, including by former President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. The other three times include \u201cin eleven South Carolina counties overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction; in two provinces of the Philippines during a 1905 insurrection; and in Hawaii after the bombing of Pearl Harbor,\u201d according to the National Constitution Center.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4566, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2894ed6b-50dc-4153-b923-1950d55f1613": {"__data__": {"id_": "2894ed6b-50dc-4153-b923-1950d55f1613", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "CNN", "title": "Homeland Security Dept. accuses lawmakers of \u2018storming\u2019 an ICE facility despite laws saying they could be there", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/10/politics/dhs-lawmakers-ice-newark-mayor-arrest", "date": null, "timestamp": "2025-05-11T11:48:02.917490"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d402a20a-9c43-40b7-9045-c841ab6f6bff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "CNN", "title": "Homeland Security Dept. accuses lawmakers of \u2018storming\u2019 an ICE facility despite laws saying they could be there", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/10/politics/dhs-lawmakers-ice-newark-mayor-arrest", "date": null, "timestamp": "2025-05-11T11:48:02.917490"}, "hash": "5270a3b46cca610e40078e207ad4be7cb95ec8fe172885be484914c2203c1514", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "SOURCE: CNN\nTITLE: Homeland Security Dept. accuses lawmakers of \u2018storming\u2019 an ICE facility despite laws saying they could be there\nDATE: None\n\nCNN \u2014 The battle over immigration came to a dramatic head Friday afternoon when Democratic lawmakers faced off with Homeland Security Department officers as they tried to visit a Newark, New Jersey, Immigration Customs and Enforcement facility, despite Congress\u2019 oversight authority of federal facilities. Three members of Congress from New Jersey, along with protesters, faced off with Department of Homeland Security officers on Friday after visiting a local ICE detention facility. The incident started as officers attempted to arrest the mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, after he tried to join the lawmakers inside the facility. As tensions grew, so did the physicality of the situation, with officers and lawmakers pushing and shouting at one another before Baraka, a Democrat, was ultimately detained for several hours. He was released Friday evening. Under the annual appropriations act, which allocates funds for federal agencies, lawmakers are permitted to enter \u201cany facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens.\u201d The law is also clear that members of Congress are not required \u201cto provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility\u201d in their oversight capacity. A spokesperson for Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, one of the lawmakers who was at the facility Friday, said the group had been allowed to enter and inspect the center sometime between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. After the incident, a DHS official suggested charges could be brought against the members of Congress and accused them of breaking into the facility, despite their legal authority to conduct oversight of the department. DHS in a statement accused the lawmakers of being \u201choled up in a guard shack\u201d after having \u201cstormed the gate\u201d to break \u201cinto the detention facility.\u201d \u201cMembers of Congress storming into a detention facility goes beyond a bizarre political stunt and puts the safety of our law enforcement agents and detainees at risk,\u201d DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement. \u201cMembers of Congress are not above the law and cannot illegally break into detention facilities.\u201d Watson Coleman, who was at the facility Friday, forcefully pushed back on the allegation that the members had broken into the facility, saying in a statement that afternoon \u201cwe did not \u2018storm\u2019 the detention center.\u201d \u201cThe author of that press release was so unfamiliar with the facts on the ground that they didn\u2019t even correctly count the number of Representatives present,\u201d the congresswoman said. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is led away in handcuffs after he took part in a protest outside an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, on Friday. News 12 New Jersey During an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cFirst of All\u201d Saturday morning, McLaughlin said ICE has footage that could lead to arrests of lawmakers. \u201cThere will likely be more arrests coming. We actually have body camera footage of some of these members of Congress assaulting our ICE enforcement officers, including body slamming a female ICE officer. So we will be showing that to viewers very shortly,\u201d she said. When pressed by CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell on whether she was suggesting the members of Congress would be arrested, McLaughlin said, \u201cthis is an ongoing investigation and that is definitely on the table.\u201d The videos were later released by the department and show the arrest of Baraka, along with more angles of the physical altercations between federal agents, protesters and members of Congress. One video appears to show Rep. LaMonica McIver using her body to push past federal agents to follow Baraka after he was placed in handcuffs and moved behind the chain-linked fence. Baraka, to whom the appropriations law doesn\u2019t apply, was held for a few hours before being released. It remains unclear why he was detained outside of the fenced-in area around the facility after he had already left the detention center. \u201cI didn\u2019t go there to break any laws. I didn\u2019t break any laws,\u201d Baraka told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on Friday shortly after being released. \u201cI was there as the mayor of the city, exercising my right and duty as an elected official, you know, supporting our congresspeople preparing for a press conference that was supposed to happen there.\u201d DHS has doubled down on its response to the incident, writing in one social media post: \u201cJust because the border is secure doesn\u2019t mean you can find new walls to climb over guys.\u201d CNN\u2019s Shania Shelton contributed to this report.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4616, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd97214f-4672-47e9-89b2-7d757ea9b69c": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd97214f-4672-47e9-89b2-7d757ea9b69c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "CNN", "title": "Pope Leo XIV explains his choice of name", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/10/world/video/pope-leo-explains-name-choice-vrtc", "date": null, "timestamp": "2025-05-11T11:48:04.983803"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "38354c98-7162-4b5c-b834-e6122fb5dabc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "CNN", "title": "Pope Leo XIV explains his choice of name", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/10/world/video/pope-leo-explains-name-choice-vrtc", "date": null, "timestamp": "2025-05-11T11:48:04.983803"}, "hash": "28ea6878bfeb373eeedad6ca15a047e045a0b3c28124887b95d99673fea732e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "SOURCE: CNN\nTITLE: Pope Leo XIV explains his choice of name\nDATE: None\n\nContent not found", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 89, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b330c55b-9363-4da1-93fa-1bda51b9d574": {"__data__": {"id_": "b330c55b-9363-4da1-93fa-1bda51b9d574", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "CNN", "title": "A failed Soviet-era spacecraft likely crashed back to Earth overnight", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/science/soviet-spacecraft-crash-kosmos-482", "date": null, "timestamp": "2025-05-11T11:48:06.808628"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7adcb57f-2106-49ec-83c3-b75288ee96b5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "CNN", "title": "A failed Soviet-era spacecraft likely crashed back to Earth overnight", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/science/soviet-spacecraft-crash-kosmos-482", "date": null, "timestamp": "2025-05-11T11:48:06.808628"}, "hash": "cf7d8bb603e0c77b865bb957c1492824a04c11dbf3513ec5542b72706b31f46f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "94d2bc5f-515a-4b85-be0a-30aeec5298dd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8364c950bbfdd72901d04a212bf21a36369280cebb9d2ebec2adb6a9f4255bc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "SOURCE: CNN\nTITLE: A failed Soviet-era spacecraft likely crashed back to Earth overnight\nDATE: None\n\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. CNN \u2014 A Soviet-era spacecraft that was designed to make a soft landing on Venus \u2014 but instead remained trapped in Earth orbit for decades \u2014 likely fell from the sky early Saturday morning, according to the European Space Agency. The object, referred to as Cosmos 482 or Kosmos 482, is believed to be a capsule launched by the Soviet Union in March 1972 that failed en route to a transfer orbit that would have taken it to Venus to study its environment. The probe entered the dense layers of the atmosphere around 9:24 a.m. Moscow time (2:24 a.m. ET) Saturday, splashing down in the Indian Ocean west of Jakarta, Indonesia, according to the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. The ESA, which was one of several organizations using ground sensors to keep tabs on the falling space junk, also said on its website that the vehicle was not spotted by radars in Germany around 7:32 UT (3:32 a.m. ET), indicating, \u201cit is most likely that the reentry has already occurred.\u201d In the decades since it was launched, Cosmos 482 circled Earth aimlessly as it was slowly dragged back toward home. Astronomers and space traffic experts have had their eyes on the object for years now as its orbital path slowly reached lower and lower altitudes, a result of the subtle atmospheric drag that exists even hundreds of miles away from Earth. The cylinder-shaped craft is about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter. This depicts the satellite-filled sky that is now a reality and getting more crowded every week! This adds together exposures taken over just 30 minutes on an early June night when, from my latitude of 51\u00b0 N satellites even in low Earth orbit are lit all night by sunlight. Many of the parallel streaks heading generally horizontal west to east (right to left) may be from groups of SpaceX Starlinks. Others traveling vertically north-south are more likely from Earth observation satellites. There is at least one natural streak in the image \u2014 a meteor at centre, caught by chance on one frame. It appears as a colored and tapered streak. Other uniform undashed streaks may be from high-altitude satellites moving much more slowly. By comparison, most satellites appear as dashed lines because the image is a blend of many 2-second-long exposures with a gap of one second between exposures when the camera shutter was closed. So the motion of the satellites and image stacking turns them into dashes. The longer the dashes, the faster the satellite is traveling, with the fastest satellites being the lowest. This is looking due south and all the trails disappear low in the south above the trees, as that's where the Earth's shadow is, even on this June night. So the satellites aren't lit when they are in that small part of the sky. They emerge from the shadow heading north and disappear into the shadow heading south. The shadow creates the obvious boundary of where satellite trails are visible. At other times of the year low-orbit satellites are visible only after sunset or before sunrise, especially from lower latitudes. But not near summer solstice, and from higher latitudes. The field of view is about 100\u00b0 by 75\u00b0.

Because the spacecraft no longer had the ability to maneuver, it was destined to undergo what space traffic experts refer to as an uncontrolled reentry \u2014 plunging back to Earth in a manner that can be extremely difficult to accurately forecast.

Each of the pieces from the rocket part can then pose a threat to the area where it lands. But Cosmos 482 was well suited to make the trip home in one piece. The spacecraft had a substantial heat shield that protected the vehicle from the intense temperatures and pressures that can build up during reentry.

Venera, as the program was called, sent a series of probes toward Venus in the 1970s and \u201980s, with several spacecraft surviving the trip and beaming data back to Earth before ceasing operations.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. CNN \u2014 Researchers have found pages of a rare medieval manuscript masquerading as a cover and stitched into the binding of another book, according to experts at the Cambridge University Library in England. The fragment contains stories about Merlin and King Arthur. The two pages are from a 13th century copy of the \u201cSuite Vulgate du Merlin.\u201d The manuscript, handwritten by a medieval scribe in Old French, served as the sequel to the legend of King Arthur. There are just over three dozen surviving copies of the sequel today. Part of a series known as the Lancelot-Grail cycle, the Arthurian romance was popular among aristocrats and royalty, said Dr. Ir\u00e8ne Fabry-Tehranchi, French specialist in collections and academic liaison at Cambridge University Library. The stories were either read aloud or performed by trouv\u00e8res, or poets, who traveled from court to court, she said. Rather than risk damaging the brittle pages by removing the stitches and unfolding them, a team of researchers were able to conduct imaging and computed tomography, or CT, scans to create a 3D model of the papers and virtually unfurl them to read the story. Multiple analyses enabled Cambridge researchers to virtually unfold the manuscript. Cambridge University Library Fabry-Tehranchi, one of the first to recognize the rarity of the manuscript, said finding it \u201cis very much a once in a lifetime experience.\u201d The scans revealed book-binding techniques from the distant past and hidden details of the repurposed manuscript that could shed light on its origins. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the text itself, but also about the material artefact,\u201d Fabry-Tehranchi said in a statement. \u201cThe way it was reused tells us about archival practices in 16th-century England. It\u2019s a piece of history in its own right.\u201d Hiding in plain sight Former Cambridge archivist Sian Collins first spotted the manuscript fragment in 2019 while recataloging estate records from Huntingfield Manor, owned by the Vanneck family of Heveningham, in Suffolk, England. Serving as the cover for an archival property record, the pages previously had been recorded as a 14th century story of Sir Gawain. But Collins, now the head of special collections and archives at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, noticed that the text was written in Old French, the language used by aristocracy and England\u2019s royal court after the Norman Conquest in 1066. She also saw names like Gawain and Excalibur within the text. Collins and the other researchers were able to decipher text describing the fight and ultimate victory of Gawain, his brothers and his father King Loth versus the Saxon Kings Dodalis, Moydas, Orianc\u00e9s, and Brandalus. The other page shared a scene from King Arthur\u2019s court in which Merlin appears disguised as a dashing harpist, according to a translation provided by the researchers: The pages were folded, torn and stitched together to create a cover for 16th century property records. Cambridge University Library \u201cWhile they were rejoicing in the feast, and Kay the seneschal (steward) brought the first dish to King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, there arrived the most handsome man ever seen in Christian lands. He was wearing a silk tunic girded by a silk harness woven with gold and precious stones which glittered with such brightness that it illuminated the whole room.\u201d Both scenes are part of the \u201cSuite Vulgate du Merlin\u201d that was originally written in 1230, about 30 years after \u201cMerlin,\u201d which tells the origin stories of Merlin and King Arthur and ends with Arthur\u2019s coronation. \u201c(The sequel) tells us about the early reign of Arthur: he faces a rebellion of British barons who question his legitimacy and has to fight external invaders, the Saxons,\u201d Fabry-Tehranchi said in an email. \u201cAll along, Arthur is supported by Merlin who advises him strategically and helps him on the battlefield.

TINTAGEL, UNITED KINGDOM - APRIL 28: The new 'Gallos' sculpture that has been erected at Tintagel Castle is seen in Tintagel on April 28, 2016 in Cornwall, England.

The team carried out CT scanning with an X-ray scanner to virtually peer through the parchment layers and create a 3D model of the manuscript fragment, revealing how the pages had been stitched together to form a cover. The CT scans showed there was likely once a leather band around the book to hold it all in place, which rubbed off some of the text. Twisted straps of parchment, called tackets, along with thread reinforced the binding. Scans across different wavelengths of light enabled the researchers to see hidden details and annotations.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. CNN \u2014 Things are heating up hundreds of miles off the coast of Oregon, where a large undersea volcano is showing signs of impending eruption, scientists say. The volcano, known as Axial Seamount, is located nearly 1 mile (1.4 kilometers) underwater on a geological hot spot, where searing gushes of molten rock rise from Earth\u2019s mantle and into the crust. Hotspot volcanoes are common on the seafloor. But Axial Seamount also happens to be located on the Juan de Fuca Ridge \u2014 an area where two massive tectonic plates (the Pacific and the Juan de Fuca plates) are constantly spreading apart, causing a steady buildup of pressure beneath the planet\u2019s surface. The frequency of earthquakes has recently picked up dramatically as the volcano inflates with increasingly more magma, signaling an eruption could be near, according to researchers at the National Science Foundation\u2019s Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array, a facility operated by the University of Washington that monitors the activity of Axial Seamount.

What happens during an eruption? During the volcano\u2019s last eruption in April 2015, the team observed about 10,000 small-scale earthquakes in a 24-hour period, and the same can be expected for the next one, Wilcock said. Magma \u2014 molten rock beneath Earth\u2019s surface \u2014 oozed out of Axial Seamount for a month and trailed about 25 miles (40 kilometers) across the seafloor, he added. The magma chamber at the heart of the volcano has also collapsed several times in the past, creating a large crater called a caldera. There, sea life thrives off the mineral-rich gases that exit through hydrothermal vents, which are like underwater hot springs. Streams of hot fluid containing billions of microbes and clumps of waste billow up from cracks in the caldera\u2019s surface, creating white plumes called \u201csnowblowers.\u201d During previous eruptions, the small plants and animals living on the hydrothermal vents were scorched by lava flows, but just three months later, their ecosystem was back and flourishing again, said Debbie Kelley, director of the Regional Cabled Array. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the biggest discoveries we\u2019ve made,\u201d said Kelley, a professor of marine geology and geophysics at the University of Washington, in a statement. \u201cLife thrives in these inhospitable environments, and volcanoes are probably one of the major sources of life in our oceans.\u201d White clouds of microbial waste billow from the seafloor. UW/NSF-OOI/CSSF-ROPOS While neighboring marine life such as fish, whales and octopuses may feel the heat and rumble of seismic shifting, they are unlikely to be harmed. And people on land probably won\u2019t notice the eruption at all, Kelley told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very explosive event. You won\u2019t see the ash clouds above water, anything like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like if you put a mile of seawater on top of Kilauea \u2026 you may see some fountaining, but that\u2019s it.\u201d In fact, most of the planet\u2019s volcanic activity takes place within underwater spreading centers such as the Juan de Fuca Ridge, which experiences multiple, small volcanic eruptions each day, Kelley said. \u201cThe magma\u2019s pretty close to the surface. It\u2019s about a mile beneath the surface, which is very shallow compared with a lot of land volcanoes, where it may be 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) deep,\u201d Kelley said, adding that the viscosity, or thickness, of the magma can affect how much pressure builds up in the magma chamber.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4272, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea286f15-1712-48cd-b83a-62ba10f6cc71": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea286f15-1712-48cd-b83a-62ba10f6cc71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "CNN", "title": "Mile-wide underwater volcano ready to erupt off the West Coast", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/science/underwater-volcano-erupt-oregon-coast", "date": null, "timestamp": "2025-05-11T11:48:10.468846"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6460ea41-96cd-4de7-87a1-429a65c00743", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "CNN", "title": "Mile-wide underwater volcano ready to erupt off the West Coast", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/science/underwater-volcano-erupt-oregon-coast", "date": null, "timestamp": "2025-05-11T11:48:10.468846"}, "hash": "fe8df26452d40e3769973cf237ba24778b04df03f5131b54b552cf00764735f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b7c2b3e-9dd0-4b77-b901-1d60c370b5c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "CNN", "title": "Mile-wide underwater volcano ready to erupt off the West Coast", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/science/underwater-volcano-erupt-oregon-coast", "date": null, "timestamp": "2025-05-11T11:48:10.468846"}, "hash": "5f57cb49cb29bc61d5e8f90b9424febff8cfd478fed298a96f67adb8de228810", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "And people on land probably won\u2019t notice the eruption at all, Kelley told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very explosive event.

Ed Ruttledge/U.S. Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory Related article Why Mount Rainier is the US volcano that troubles scientists most How to watch Luckily, the relative mildness of Axial Seamount makes it perfect for close human observation. The next time the volcano erupts, the observatory even plans to publicly livestream the event, which has never been done before, Kelley said. Observing an undersea volcanic eruption is no easy task. Scientists only directly witnessed one in action for the first time on April 29. In the Pacific Ocean, about 1,300 miles (2,092 kilometers) west of Costa Rica, researchers partnering with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, or WHOI, were on a routine submersible dive to collect data on the East Pacific Rise when they noticed the once-vibrant Tica vents were no longer teeming with sea life. Instead, the team found a charred \u201ctubeworm barbeque,\u201d as WHOI Emeritus Research Scholar Dan Fornari put it. Flashes of orange lava leaked through the seafloor before hardening in the freezing water, indicating an eruption was taking place. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a significant development,\u201d Fornari said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very understudied environment, because it\u2019s hard to reach and because we have to use clever technology to understand it. \u2026 At the heart of it, we are watching (the) ways in which this planet gets built, gets constructed by volcanism on the seafloor.\u201d Tubeworms grow on the unique rock formations of the Axial Seamount. UW/NSF-OOI As above, so below Unexpectedly, close observation of Axial Seamount has revealed the timing of its eruption isn\u2019t just about what\u2019s bubbling beneath the surface \u2014 it also has to do with what\u2019s above. All three of the most recent eruptions \u2014 in 1998, 2011 and 2015 \u2014 have occurred between January and April, the time of year when Earth is moving away from the sun. \u201cI don\u2019t think we fully understand why that is, but it may be related to the (gravitational) forces from the moon influencing the volcano,\u201d Wilcock said.

John Fh\u00e6r Engedal Nissen/The National Museum of Denmark Related article Archaeologists discover true identity of Costa Rica shipwrecks long thought to be pirate ships The moon orbits Earth each month, and its gravitational pull moves ocean tides up and down, causing pressure variations on the seafloor. As the volcano\u2019s magma chamber reaches critical mass, these pressure changes put more stress on the caldera, the crater of the volcano created by previous eruptions. The pressure of high tide also causes more frequent earthquakes, slowly stressing the chamber to its breaking point, Kelley said.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3457, "end_char_idx": 7250, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"97d1444f-3325-46fb-883b-416ac50709b6": {"node_ids": ["b2c9ef0b-b7b7-4d5e-9c46-51630eabadfe"], "metadata": {"source": "CNN", "title": "Catch up on today\u2019s global news", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/", "date": null, "timestamp": "2025-05-11T11:47:52.994594"}}, "eb933fc0-9fd7-442f-bf6a-e31c11b24f75": {"node_ids": ["ea933d22-e1b9-4ad1-87d6-6add92de10d0", "f2178b98-24a5-4fa9-9d12-2f423d9cb3d3"], "metadata": {"source": "CNN", "title": "This mayoral candidate is currently being held for crimes against humanity.
